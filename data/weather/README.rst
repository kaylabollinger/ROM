NOAA Sea Surface Temperature
============================

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Physical Sciences Laboratory (PSL) conducts research to improve observations, understanding, modeling and predictions of weather, water and climate extremes, and their related impacts. As part of their work, PSL archives a wide range of weather data ranging from gridded climate datasets extending hundreds of years to real-time wind profiler data at a single location. In this work, we consider daily long-term average sea surface temperature (SST) data, and in particular the SST averaged over the 30-year period 1971-2000. Modeling SST is important for numerical weather prediction (as it influences the atmosphere above) and other tasks, such as calibrating measurements from weather satellites.

This dataset consists of 365 snapshots with a 0.25 degree latitude x 0.25 degree longitude global grid spatial coverage containing 1440x720 points. The data is made publicly available by NOAA PSL from their `website <https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.noaa.oisst.v2.highres.html>`_. Due to large file size, the data is not stored in this repository. This data can instead be found `here <https://psl.noaa.gov/repository/entry/show/PSL+Climate+Data+Repository/Public/PSL+Datasets/PSL+Gridded+Datasets/noaa.oisst.v2.highres/sst.day.mean.ltm.1971-2000.nc?entryid=synth\%3Ae570c8f9-ec09-4e89-93b4-babd5651e7a9\%3AL25vYWEub2lzc3QudjIuaGlnaHJlcy9zc3QuZGF5Lm1lYW4ubHRtLjE5NzEtMjAwMC5uYw\%3D\%3D&output=html.info>`_.
