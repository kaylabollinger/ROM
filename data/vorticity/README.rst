Fluid Vorticity Field
=====================

Characterizing dominant patterns in flow fields has been an important area of research towards making fluids more manageable within engineering design. In this thesis, we consider time series data of a fluid vorticity field for the wake behind a cylinder at Reynolds number :math:`Re = 100`. For the creation of this dataset, the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations was simulated using an immersed boundary projection method fluid solver. 

This dataset consists of 151 snapshots of steady-state vortex shedding with a spatial grid containing 450x200 points. The original source for this data can be found at `here <http://dmdbook.com/>`_.
