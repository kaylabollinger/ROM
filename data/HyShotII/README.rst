HyShot II
=========

The HyShot II scramjet (supersonic combustion engine) was the first successful launch in the research project of The University of Queensland, Australia Centre for Hypersonics. Scramjets are economic alternatives to rockets, useful for tasks such as low-cost satellite launches and high-speed missile propulsion. Here, we consider data created by simulating the normalized integral of pressure over the end of the HyShot II vehicle (a quantity used to judge the performance of the vehicle and to determine if a failure resulting in loss of thrust has occurred) with respect to 7 input parameters: angle of attack, turbulence intensity, turbulence length scale, stagnation pressure, stagnation enthalpy, cowl transition location, and ramp transition location. 

This dataset consists of 52 total samples. The original source for this data can be found `here <https://github.com/paulcon/as-data-sets/tree/master/HyShotII>`_.
