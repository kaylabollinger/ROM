ONERA M6 Wing
=============

The ONERA M6 wing was developed by the Office National dEtudes et de Recherches Aerospatiales (ONERA) Aerodynamics Department. This design is the 3D analog of the NACA 0012 airfoil--a wing design whose simple, symmetric structure has made it an ideal test case for complicated flow physics. Similar to the NACA 0012 dataset, the dataset we consider here is the drag coefficient of the wing (computed via SU2) with respect to 50 free-form deformation parameters (FFD). FFD is a technique used to model simple deformations of 3D objects by enclosing the object in another hull object (e.g., a cube) and transforming the object based on the deformation of the hull. 

This dataset consists of 297 total samples and contains gradient information for each sample The original source for this data can be found at `here <https://github.com/paulcon/as-data-sets/tree/master/ONERA-M6>'_.
